# HoneyPi

HoneyPi is a portable honeypot used for intrusion detection and exploitation analysis.  This device allows connectivity to deployed decoy environments that
are designed to attract cyber threat actors.  Using docker containers, the HoneyPi simulates realistic targets and fictitious sensitive data.  By intentionally
exposing the decoy environments to a local network, HoneyPi allows system administrators to observe and log common attack methods in a controlled environment.

The purpose of HoneyPi is to educate users on the common techniques threat actors might use to compromise a system.  Using the device for its intended
purpose enables cybersecurity professionals to:

  - Understand how attackers operate.
  - Learn about common tactics, techniques, and procedures used by adversaries.
  - Develop cyber defense strategies based on real attack data.

By showcasing the importance of proactive security measures, HoneyPi contributes to raising awareness and equipping
its users with practical knowledge of how to detect and mitigate cyber threats.
