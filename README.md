# HoneyPi

HoneyPi is a portable honeypot used for intrusion detection and exploitation analysis.  This device allows connectivity to deployed decoy environments that
are designed to attract cyber threat actors.  Using docker containers, the HoneyPi simulates realistic targets and fictitious sensitive data.  By intentionally
exposing the decoy environments to a local network, HoneyPi allows system administrators to observe and log common attack methods in a controlled environment.

The purpose of HoneyPi is to educate users on the common techniques threat actors might use to compromise a system.  Using the device for its intended
purpose enables cybersecurity professionals to:

  - Understand how attackers operate.
  - Learn about common tactics, techniques, and procedures used by adversaries.
  - Develop cyber defense strategies based on real attack data.

By showcasing the importance of proactive security measures, HoneyPi contributes to raising awareness and equipping
its users with practical knowledge of how to detect and mitigate cyber threats. 

## Create/Deploy

Due to HoneyPi being a physical tool, there is no specific software installation for its use.
Rather, users may follow the methodology provided to create and configure their own, personalized version of the
HoneyPi device.

1. Prerequisites:

2. Install Docker:

3. Clone HoneyPi Repository:

4. Build and Deploy Docker Containers:

5. Configure Container Orchestration & Monitoring:

## Usage

HoneyPi is a portable, lightweight, intrusion detection system (IDS).  Users may use the device to monitor threat actor behaviors on their network...

## __Ethical Notice__

This project is designed for educational and research purposes.  It should only be used as a tool intended to help individuals and organizations
improve their understanding of cybersecurity and enhance their defensive strategies.  Users should be mindful to ensure the HoneyPi is only used on authorized
networks where all participants are informed of its deployment and have provided explicit consent.

Any data collected during the operation of HoneyPi should be handled responsibly and effectively to avoid
any harm being done to individuals or organizations.
