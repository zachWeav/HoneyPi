# HoneyPi Test Plan

## Test Plan Identifier:

Each test case provided will be labeled as "HPI-TC01", "HPI-TC02", etc. Using this labeling convention will
allow for easy location between both this test case document, and the Excel document that will be
used for test case execution.

Requirements document:


## Test Items:

-   HoneyPi Device

## Device Features to be Tested:

-   Scanning Device for open ports

-   Decoy SSH server connection

-   Decoy SQL Database connection



## Features Not to be Tested:


## Approach:


## Item Pass/Fail Criteria:

Whether or not a test case passes or fails will be determined by a defined
set of questions including:

-   Is the feature of the device functional?

-   Does specific functionality perform as expected?

-   Are there any errors when executing the tests?

-   Was the test sufficient?

If anything still needs to be addressed after executing a test case, 
then the test case is a failure. The device must be fixed and
the feature tested again asking the same questions. If all required criteria are met
with no additional issues found, then the test will be considered a pass.

## HoneyPi Test Cases:



## Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements:



## Test Deliverables:

-   HoneyPi Test Plan

-   HoneyPi Test Cases (excel)

## Test Environment:


## Estimate:

There are no monetary costs involved for the development or testing of the
device and every tool being used is open sourced and available for public use.
